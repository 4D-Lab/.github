# 4D - Data-Driven Drug Design

The 4D **Data-Driven Drug Design** group develops and applies advanced computational strategies to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics.
Our research integrates physics-based molecular modeling, modern AI and data science, and large-scale high-performance computing to tackle drug discovery challenges that are infeasible with conventional approaches alone.


## 🔭 What We Do
- **High-Performance Computing:** We utilize national and EuroHPC resources for ultra-large-scale virtual screening and long-timescale simulations.
- **Data-Centric Design:** We curate and mine large datasets to benchmark tools and guide decision-making.
- **Hybrid Workflows:** We merge classical simulation methods with AI and Machine Learning to explore chemical space efficiently.
- **Explainable AI:** We build tools that provide intuitive, transparent insights for medicinal chemists.

##  🤝 Connect With Us
We collaborate closely with experimental partners in academia and industry to validate our models and discover active compounds.
